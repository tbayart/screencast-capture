Screencast Capture Lite is a tool for recording the desktop screen and saving it to a video file, preserving quality as much as possible.
However, this does not mean it produces gigantic files which take a long time to be uploaded to the web.
The application encodes everything using solely H624 in an almost lossless setting.

The application currently supports recording from the primary screen, from a chosen window or from a fixed region.
There are few options to configure encoding at this time, mostly on purpose to keep things simple.

The software stores videos on the My Videos directory and allows the user to browse them directly from within the application.
The software has just been released, so it is expected to have a few bugs.

Screencast Capture Lite is also a live demonstration of the [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) Framework in a real-world application.
